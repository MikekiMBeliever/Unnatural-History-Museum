[[Continue |continue]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="continue" tags="" position="475,525" size="100,100">Your first shift begins in exactly seven minutes, but you park and decide to linger in the deserted lot for a moment longer. You listen to the sound of the summer rain drumming against the rusted roof of your truck. To your nervous ears, every droplet echoes like a warning, or a curse. Lightning streaks across the granite sky overhead, followed by a roar of thunder torn straight from the mouth of a giant. The towering pine trees that envelop the museum property begin to sway in the growing wind, the green branches waving at you in greeting.

The sudden onset of this bad weather makes you uneasy. Your grip on the steering wheel tightens. 

Despite the noise from the storm, you can still make out a woman’s faint, mournful voice drifting from the truck’s radio, singing to you a ghost story, occasionally interrupted by bouts of static. You check your watch again. Five minutes. 

From the outside, the museum doesn’t look like much: a large, two-story building, designed to resemble a log cabin that you might find nestled deep in the woods. A sign hangs over the front entrance, displaying the name of the museum in bright, yellow hand-painted letters:  [[The Unnatural History Museum]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="The Unnatural History Museum" tags="" position="475,650" size="100,100">It’s not what you expected based on the crumpled-up [[flyer]] that sticks out from your [[unzipped backpack]] in the passenger seat. Nor is it what you had envisioned after reading the most recent [[letter]] you had received from Mr. Nogard, the owner of the museum.

It hardly resembles a backpack at this point, but you’ve had it for so long you can’t bear to throw it out. Inside, it holds: your wallet, a pencil case, a notebook, a paperback copy of Edith Hamilton’s //Mythology//, a baseball cap, a water bottle, trail mix, a couple of crystals, a roll of duct tape (just in case), and some gum.

[[Return |The Unnatural History Museum]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="letter" tags="" position="675,800" size="100,100">A short letter you had received from Mr. Nogard, informing you that you had gotten the job. It reads:

Dear, 

Congratulations! You are the only one who applied for the security guard position at The Unnatural History Museum. I found your answers to the job application somewhat satisfactory, and by process of elimination, I have no choice but to hire you. Please report to the museum on June 2nd at 8:00 PM sharp for your first night shift. Further instructions will be provided once you arrive. We may negotiate your pay at a later date, though I’d prefer if we did not. Please stay safe and arrive at the museum in one piece. 

Best, 

Kiernan Nogard
Curator of The Unnatural History Museum
Spoons, Oregon

[[Return |The Unnatural History Museum]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="flyer" tags="" position="275,800" size="100,100">A flyer you had found floating around campus, advertising a job opening for a security guard at The Museum of Unnatural History. It didn’t seem like a bad way to spend your summer, and you figured it would look good on your resume, being a folklore major and all with a special interest in myths and legends.

[[Return |The Unnatural History Museum]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="AfterTest" tags="" position="1150,400" size="100,100">Somehow, your answers must have been the right ones. Or, the questions could have been complete nonsense and now you’re working for a complete lunatic. Still, you decide to make the most of it. Spoons is, after all, a small, isolated town by the sea, complete with anti-social locals and a cryptid museum; a quiet and peaceful place to continue the reading and writing that’s necessary for your research. 

After putting it off for another minute longer, you finally cut the engine and peer through your window. The rain doesn’t look like it will be letting up any time soon, and your watch tells you that you now only have two minutes left. Resigning yourself to the fact that you are about to be utterly soaked, you grab your backpack and pull on your baseball cap before making a mad dash to the front entrance of the museum. 

[[Continue |Aftertest2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Aftertest2" tags="" position="1150,525" size="100,100">You’ve never really been the athletic type, so naturally you collide face-first into a glass door as you throw yourself beneath the safety of the awning that covers the front entrance, offering you protection from the rain. Rubbing your aching chin, you lean against the door and take a moment to catch your breath.

Now that you’ve left the safety of your truck, you can make out the faint smell of salt and sea breeze permeating the air, and you recall catching glimpses of the coast on your drive over here. Somewhere, beyond the museum and the trees lies the ocean. It’s almost pleasant, if not for the storm, your wet clothes, and the cold you’re most definitely going to catch. It’s going to be a long night for you.

[[Continue |Aftertest3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Aftertest3" tags="" position="1150,650" size="100,100">Suddenly, the back of your neck starts to prickle. Blood running cold, you turn around and peer into the parking lot. You see nothing but your truck and nighttime shadows. Still, you can’t shake off the feeling that you’re being watched. 

[[Continue |Aftertest4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="Vampire" tags="" position="1850,300" size="100,100">You arrive on the second floor. Immediately you realize that the geography of this building doesn’t make any sense. There is a room towards the south, where the entrance should be, but there is no indication on the first floor that there is a room above the entrance. What in the world? This is your life now. Oh my god.

Anyways. You’re supposed to be familiarizing yourself with the second floor. You figure you should go around and see what’s on this floor, since it’s inexplicably larger than the first. You decide to begin by going straight, into the northern room.
&lt;&lt;set $Vampire to 0&gt;&gt;
[[Continue |Vampire2]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="Vampire2" tags="" position="1850,425" size="100,100">You enter the northern room. The room is dim, with a single chandelier at the center providing the entirety of the light. It dangles gently, like a cat toy. In the middle of the room, right beneath the chandelier, is a black wooden coffin lined with gold. You immediately make note of the imminent fire hazard.

Around the room there are various pieces of historical paraphernalia, which you can vaguely make out. There is a silver teapot and accompanying set on a velvet-lined table. There are stakes mounted to the leftmost wall, of varying length and material. On the rightmost wall, you can see a large wardrobe that covers nearly the entire room.

“Hello.”

Suddenly you see a small, green, wrinkly man in front of you. He is wearing a black butler uniform. You think this is a goblin, but you don’t want to be racist. He speaks in a soft, older voice.

“My name is Alfred. Do you care to see the mistress?”


[["Yes"]]
[["No"]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="&quot;Yes&quot;" tags="" position="1850,550" size="100,100">“EXCELLENT!” he screams. Your ears bleed, but just a little. You don’t care that much.

Alfred grabs your hand and you are taken towards the black coffin. He knocks on the top of the coffin and then recedes into the darkness.

Suddenly, the lid of the coffin starts to rise until the coffin is fully opened. From where you stand, you see that the coffin has been furnished with plushy, red velvet. Faded, yellow photographs and dried flowers adorn the interior of the coffin. Gathering your courage, you step closer towards the coffin and [[peer inside |Vampire3]].
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="&quot;No&quot;" tags="" position="1975,550" size="100,100">He screams at you. “YOU MUST!”

Alfred grabs your hand and you are taken towards the black coffin. He knocks on the top of the coffin and then recedes into the darkness.

[[Continue |Vampire3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="VampireFinal" tags="" position="1850,1075" size="100,100">She doesn’t give you time to think of a proper response before she steps out of her coffin. Now that she’s standing, you realize she’s much taller than you. You try not to feel too intimidated. 

“You must be the new security guard Mr. Nogard hired,” the vampire says, wrinkling her nose as she looks down on you. “Though you look about as useful as a suitcase without a handle.” 

“Thank you.”

“I’m Victoria Mae,” she continues. “I don’t care to learn your name. I doubt you’ll last long enough for it to matter.” That seems encouraging. “Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to start getting ready for the night. Begone, human.”

Since you value your life, you move onto the next room. 

[[Onto the next |Mermaid]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="Vampire3" tags="" position="1850,675" size="100,100">Lying on her back is a girl, with her eyes closed and her skin as pale as paper, and not a single strand of her golden hair lying out of place. Despite the fact that she looks to be about your age, and that she looks perfectly harmless lying there in her silk pajamas, you’re pretty sure you know what she is. You quickly put two-and-two together: the coffin, the exhibit. Surely, this must be[[… |Vampire4]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="Mermaid" tags="" position="2325,325" size="100,100">You enter the eastern room. Immediately the smell of salty seawater hits your nostrils like a truck. This room is certainly better lit than the previous room, but that’s not saying much. You enter the eastern room. Immediately the smell of salty seawater hits your nostrils like a truck. The floor has white marble tiling, and the walls are made of the same material. At the center of the room is a small pool of blue water, absolutely pristine. 

The light of the room feels serene, like vague sunlight is constantly glimmering on the surface of the pool. There seems to be no ceiling light. You make a note to check the lighting fixtures in this room for fire hazards. At the edge of the pool is what looks to be a discarded pink perm wig. It’s crunchy as hell. You don’t want to be judgemental, but this perm is definitely in need of being moisturized.

Suddenly, and without any warning, four small trout pop out of the pool of water. Upon closer inspection, they all seem to have fur. Oh shit! These are fur-bearing trout! You wrote a research paper on them in your first semester of college. [[What the fuck are they doing in saltwater? |Mermaid2]]
&lt;&lt;set $Mermaid to 0&gt;&gt;





</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="Mermaid2" tags="" position="2325,450" size="100,100">They begin to sing in a barbershop quartet.

“Hello!”
“Hello!”
“Hello!”
“Hell-o!”

Music starts playing, but there is absolutely no source for it that you can discern. Your hair stands on end. The trout continue to sing, in tandem. 

“Dear visitor, we welcome you! We want to know how you'll do! The mermaid here is quite a mess! But when she wakes, you’ll be impressed!”

You have to admit, their harmony is &lt;&lt;cycle "$answer" autoselect&gt;&gt;

	&lt;&lt;option "pretty good"&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $answer == "fine"&gt;&gt;“Thanks kid. You ain’t so bad yourself.”
You smile and give them a thumbs-up.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $answer == "pretty good"&gt;&gt;“We want you carnally, kid.”
You don’t know how to respond to that so you just smile and nod. 
+1 RELATIONSHIP WITH FUR BEARING TROUT
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $answer == "pretty shit"&gt;&gt;“Get fucked kid.”
You decide to not take that personally.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $answer == "okay, but what are you doing in saltwater?"&gt;&gt;“What are you doing in those fuckass shorts? Get real, kid”
You think your shorts are actually pretty nice, but you decide it’s best to not argue with the fur-bearing trout. 
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;

[[Continue |Mermaid4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="Mermaid4" tags="" position="2325,700" size="100,100">Suddenly, the wig at the corner of the pool starts to move. You realize that the wig is not, in fact, a wig, but the hair of a completely separate entity. A beautiful mermaid, with a long pink perm, pops her head out of the water. She starts to speak, and her voice is like a gentle stream.

“Would you all shut the fuck up?” she screams.

“Cheese it boys,” one of the fish says.

The fish immediately recede into the water. She suddenly becomes aware of your presence, blushes, and tries to hide her face with her hair. You notice that she doesn’t sink her head below the water. 

She checks to make sure that you’re still there. You decide to give a little wave, to be polite. God knows you weren’t raised in a barn. She jumps out of the water, leaving her tail in the pool.

“Hello, visitor. Sorry you had to see that. My name is Pearl. You caught me while I was taking a nap. Nogard did mention we would have a visitor, but I guess I forgot.”

You explain that you’re the new security guard. You also explain your interest in cryptozoology, since it seems rather pertinent. You marvel at your usage of the word “pertinent.” Pearl seems to relax a bit and starts twirling her hair.

“Oh, I understand. You are a researcher of some sort. Well, as you can see, I am a mermaid. Fish tail. Human top half. Though I am not sure I am a really good mermaid, to be honest. But that is probably oversharing. Sorry. You should just go. I will compose myself better soon, I promise.”

You hesitate for a moment, unsure of how to proceed. Ultimately, you decide to…

You observe her, looking at her face incredibly closely. You see that her face turns bright red. You wonder if that’s a feature of all mermaids or just this one.

“I mean it! Go! Get out of here! I am having a crisis!”

At her insistence, you get up and you leave the room. You smell like fish now.

You are met with a massive pine forest, and the aroma of sweet sap and bitter pinestraw fills your senses. The light in the room is like the sun on a perfect day, and there even seems to be a blue sky somehow. It reminds you of your time hiking in the mountains with your family. Man. You should send your mother a letter. She misses you, probably. 

Don’t cry now. You remind yourself that there might be cool cryptids watching. You man the hell up.

As you continue further into the room, you realize that this forest seems to go on for a good while. You really should’ve brought some hiking shoes or something. At least your calves will look fantastic after this.

After a while, you come across a beautiful stream that stretches out as far as the eye can see on either side. At the center, there is a small bridge that you can cross. 

Before you can even move, you see a small, rabbit-like creature bound across the bridge. It has massive, curling antlers poking out from its head. You immediately clock this thing as a jackalope. You did a presentation about these things last year and the professor did not jive with it. You’ve had a vendetta against them ever since. Your eyes widen. It looks at you, playfully, as if inviting you to come cross with it.

You don’t want to be squished into a little pancake by a falling rock and then have to walk away with two little legs. At least, not today.

You reject the jackalope’s offer and continue down the path yourself.

Your pride is wounded and there is no affordable cure on the market. Saddening.

At least the jackalope seems happy.

This must be “the mistress” that Alfred had so desperately wanted you to meet.

There are small tents littered around the area, along with unlit wooden campfires and food scattered around the floor. Sitting pensively on a stump, you see a large, hairy man. He is petting the jackalope gently in his lap, and is wearing a simple pair of camo swim trunks.

He does not look at you as you enter. You get the feeling that he doesn’t expect anyone to regard him.

You cough. He looks up at you, surprised, and gets up. He puts the jackalope on his shoulder, like a familiar.

“Oh, dude, so sorry! Didn’t see you there, brah. That’s on me. Apologies.”

He pats you on the shoulder, ever so gently, with his massive ape hands.

“The name’s Josh. This little lady on my shoulder is Jackie. She doesn’t talk much.”

Jack stares at you intensely. You want to vomit upon seeing her terrible rabbit eyes, but you hold it back.

“Ha, ha, yeah. She likes you. But I’m what they call a sasquatch. Ape-man. Bigfoot. Whatever floats your boat. Not much of my business what people call me. I’m just Josh, you know what I mean? What’s good with you?”

You explain what’s good with you and introduce yourself. “I’m $name.” You find that this guy is pretty chill and easy to talk to.

“Oh, nice. That’s chill. So I guess we’ll be seeing you around here more, huh? That’s fine. Not many people really wanna talk to me or like, get to know me or anything.”

She practically shoves the book into your hands. Her hands feel both cold and hot at the same time.

“Well, please let me know what you think of the book. Good-bye for now, $name.”

Her face seems colder than normal as she looks you up and down before turning away and making her way back to her coffin. She picks up a well-thumbed copy of //Dracula// and ignores you.

Yeah, she kind of is, by traditional mermaid standards. But still. Seeing Pearl in “the throes of a malaise” makes you feel bad. You wonder, for a moment, how someone could even leave an underwater city like Atlantis. What path through water do they have to take? Are maps of the world different from the perspective of a fish? What does mermaid meat taste like?

You put these questions aside. Someone’s gotta help a girl out. Besides, it’s just a little pool. It can't be that hard to get something back. You decide to offer your help to Pearl to recover her lost candy dish. 

Pearl looks up at you, excitedly, and rubs the tears away from her eyes.

“Oh, my, do you mean it? Are you certain? You do not have to solve my problems, $name.”

You reassure Pearl and look into the briney deep of the pool she lives in. As you look in, you realize that it is MUCH deeper than you initially anticipated. Oh shit. Well, you can’t take it back now.

+1 RELATIONSHIP POINTS WITH JOSH

Josh gives you a firm hug, and you reciprocate. You can feel the forest around you getting dimmer, as you realize the sun has finally begun to set. Huh. Interesting.

Josh looks at you and says, “Thank you for that conversation, bro. I don’t think I 
would’ve really been able to process all that without your help. You’re much nicer than the last security guard, I’ll tell you that much.”

Josh gets up from the stump, and Jackie jumps off of his lap. He pats you on the back, with a firmness that you are frankly not used to. “Let me take you back to where you came from. I imagine you got some more shit to do, yeah?”

Josh and Jackie walk with you back to the entrance of the room. The entire time, you and Josh are able to talk, crack wise, and generally have a good time together. Jackie seems pleased with herself. She gets that look in her eye. You know the one.

You figure, as you keep walking, that Josh might need more than just one talk to help him feel better. He’s a complicated guy, and maybe no one’s given him a chance before. Could you be that person?

As you reach the entrance, Josh stops you on your way out.

“Thank you again, man. I don’t have much, but I did want to give you this.”

Josh rummages through his pockets and pulls out a ''wooden charm necklace''.

“This is a rabbit’s foot charm that I made while I was still working in the carpentry 
biz. It’s really nothing much, but I think it’s about time for me to let go of that part of 
my past. Move forward, you know? With a new perspective. Yeah. Anyways, I’m 
gonna smoke. But, really, honestly: thank you.”

Josh and Jackie bound away. Jackie looks back at you for a moment before she leaves, winks, and hops away.

Oh well! No time to think about that right now! You got things to do, girl!

+3 RELATIONSHIP POINTS WITH JOSH

Josh gives you a firm hug, and you reciprocate. You can feel the forest around you getting dimmer, as you realize the sun has finally begun to set. Huh. Interesting.

Josh looks at you and says, “Thank you for that conversation, bro. I don’t think I 
would’ve really been able to process all that without your help. You’re much nicer than the last security guard, I’ll tell you that much.”

Josh gets up from the stump, and Jackie jumps off of his lap. He pats you on the back, with a firmness that you are frankly not used to. “Let me take you back to where you came from. I imagine you got some more shit to do, yeah?”

Josh and Jackie walk with you back to the entrance of the room. The entire time, you and Josh are able to talk, crack wise, and generally have a good time together. Jackie seems pleased with herself. She gets that look in her eye. You know the one.

You figure, as you keep walking, that Josh might need more than just one talk to help him feel better. He’s a complicated guy, and maybe no one’s given him a chance before. Could you be that person?

As you reach the entrance, Josh stops you on your way out.

“Thank you again, man. I don’t have much, but I did want to give you this.”

Josh rummages through his pockets and pulls out a ''wooden charm necklace''.

“This is a rabbit’s foot charm that I made while I was still working in the carpentry 
biz. It’s really nothing much, but I think it’s about time for me to let go of that part of 
my past. Move forward, you know? With a new perspective. Yeah. Anyways, I’m 
gonna smoke. But, really, honestly: thank you.”

Josh and Jackie bound away. Jackie looks back at you for a moment before she leaves, winks, and hops away.

Oh well! No time to think about that right now! You got things to do, girl!

It becomes so loud you can hardly hear your own thoughts, until it reaches a final, crashing crescendo. Everything becomes quiet. You can still make out the faint sound of buzzing, but somehow you’re able to understand it as if it were everyday English.

//Bzzzzz// [Are you alright?]

This is weird. This is really fucking weird. It’s like when you’re listening to the radio with a bad signal, and suddenly the channel you’re on overlaps with another, the voices fighting to sing over the other until they create a discordant harmony. The buzzing noise remains, but you can still understand what the creature is trying to say.

Victoria Mae’s coffin is still open, so you take this as a chance to better examine the 
photographs that are taped to the underside of the lid. 

One picture shows a group of girls gathered on the steps of a wide front porch attached to a fantastically large Southern house with gleaming white pillars. In the distance stretches fields of some crop you cannot identify. All of them are wearing hoop skirts, hats, and gloves. You easily find Victoria Mae in the crowd, as she is the tallest girl present. In the picture, she’s staring the camera down without a smile, her posture perfect and her chin slightly lifted.

In another picture, Victoria Mae is sitting beneath the shade of a magnolia tree, reading a book. The photographer must have caught her off-guard, because her face is slightly blurred as she looks up at the camera in surprise.

One [[engraved portrait]] stands out to you among the rest. The woman it portrays doesn’t resemble Victoria Mae, but you can tell somehow just by looking at her that she is a vampire as well. Her ancient eyes seem to follow you. 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="136" name="engraved portrait" tags="Artifact" position="4800,875" size="100,100">&lt;img src="Assets/VampMom.jpg" alt="Creepy Vampire Lady :3"/&gt;

“That’s my mother.” Victoria Mae’s voice startles you. “Laurel, was her name.” You whirl around to find her standing only a few feet away from you, watching you carefully. She had changed out of her pajamas into a silk blouse, buttoned up all the way, and a satiny blue floor-length skirt. Dangling from ears you spot golden earrings inlaid with sparkling rubies, and her fingers are adorned with a collection of rings. Everything she wears, from her jewelry to her clothes, must have cost a fortune. 

Victoria Mae takes a step closer to you and the coffin, her marble-like features softening as she gazes upon the portrait, lost in a moment of time forgotten by all except her. 

“She wasn’t my real mother, of course,” Victoria Mae continues. “I hardly remember 
my actual parents, but I couldn’t have asked for a better mother, or a better mentor. For me and my sisters. You’d never suspect, but she raised us vegetarian. Easier to hide from humans that way.” She sighs sadly. You resist the urge to pat her on the head.

A tourist trap, certainly, but then there is that  unusual questionnaire Mr. Nogard had mailed to you previously as part of your job application. It’s strange that he never requested to interview you in person, but maybe it’s for the best, considering how far of a drive it is to Spoons from Portland. 

You think back on how you answered those questions, your trepidation growing as  you remember how weird they’d been.

A wooden table sits in the center, surrounded by a collection of mismatched chairs. Stuck in the middle of the table is [[a rusted sword]] that looks like it’s been there since the beginning of the time. 

In the corner of the room, lies [[a white fridge]], covered in colorful magnets and yellowish stains. Balanced precariously on top of the fridge is [[a cardboard box.]]

On the other side of the break room is what seems like a little kitchen area complete with [[wooden cabinets]], linoleum counters, [[an oven]], and [[a stove.]]

Amidst the jungle of potted plants, you spot a few bundles of [[pamphlets]] and [[flyers]] lying about, intended for visitors of the museum. You also notice a [[letter |NogardLetter]] neatly placed right where you could see it.

[[return|the gift shop.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="158" name="rare collectibles." tags="" position="1150,1250" size="100,100">Another shelf is lined with musty jars. Curious, you decide to open one. Inside, lies a single eyeball. It rolls around the bottom of the jar like a grape, making a squelching noise. You regret your choice immediately, and hurriedly put the jar back where you found it.

[[return|the gift shop.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="159" name="barrels" tags="" position="1275,1250" size="100,100">You choose a barrel at random and look inside. This one is filled with hats. You pick one up and it reads: “WOMEN FEAR ME, JERSEY DEVILS WANT ME.” Nice. 

[[return|the gift shop.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="160" name="posters" tags="Artifact" position="775,1375" size="100,100">You examine the posters. One is an artistic rendition of Medusa. Most of the image is taken up by the writhing mass of her hair. Her eyes are the same gold color as the snakes’, they gleam at you, almost sultry. One tear is frozen in place on her cheek, immortalizing her sorrow. The sign beneath the poster reads “Medusa: Medusa was cursed by Athena after being violated on the goddess’s sacred grounds, turning her hair to snakes, and making anyone she gazed upon turn to stone. She was killed by Perseus, who beheaded her using a mirror to guide him.”

The other posters are similar, all showing monsters from classical mythology

&lt;&lt;set $seenPosters to 1&gt;&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="161" name="display case" tags="" position="900,1375" size="100,100">You approach the display case and examine what’s inside. Fragments of pottery are laid out on a shelf with dates. The sign informs you that the jar they once formed told the story of Jason, the hero who led the Argonauts. In the pieces you can see slivers of faces, remnants of what surely was once the legendary ship the Argo.

You approach the statue. It is some kind of quadruped, with taloned feet and an arching body similar to that of a wild dog’s. The entire thing looks like some kind of cursed dog. As you get closer you can make out the aspects of the creature that seem particularly [[cursed]].

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="163" name="cursed" tags="" position="1025,1500" size="100,100">The tail arcing above the torso of the creature is scaled, and terminates with the head of a snake, fanged and scaly. Where the neck of the creature should begin there are in fact two necks, leading to two distinct [[heads.]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="164" name="heads." tags="" position="1025,1625" size="100,100">One seems to begin too early for a neck, almost branching out of the things back. It is the head of a goat, with horns that arc back close to the snake’s face, and one of the little tufty beards that all goats seem to have. The other head is where you would expect a head to be. Out of a sculpted mane rises the head of a lion, maw agape and full of darkness where the dim lighting of the room does not reach.

Thinking back to your ancient Greek mythology class you took in your first year, you determine the thing is a [[chimera]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="165" name="chimera" tags="" position="1025,1750" size="100,100">A plaque mounted on the pedestal under one taloned foot confirms your findings. It reads “Chimera, Greece, 380-360 BC” and beneath that “The Chimera is an ancient Greek beast with the head of a lion, body of a fire-breathing goat, and tail of a serpent. She is known for her ferocity. Legend says she was killed by Bellerophon the hero, aided by the gods.”

This sounds familiar now. You can’t quite seem to remember the details of the story. You look around the room to see if there are any other signs of some kind, but the rest of the exhibit is about other Greek myths.

Out of the corner of your eye you detect movement, and turn back to the statue.

As you stand there, you could swear you see the the snake’s tongue dart in and out, but when you look closer it is completely [[still]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="166" name="still" tags="" position="1025,1875" size="100,100">Or maybe not so still, because as you watch the statue begins to shift into motion, metal muscles lurching into a kind of base animalistic movement. All three heads swivel to watch you staring. Before you have a chance to say anything the chimera leaps off of the pedestal and begins stalking the room. For a beast made of metal its footsteps are surprisingly [[quiet]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="167" name="quiet" tags="" position="1025,2000" size="100,100">It’s voice however, when it speaks, is not. 

“Who are you?” she begins, the words emanating from the lion’s maw, while the other heads remain still, watching you. Though she speaks in a growl, you don’t think it is out of hostility. Perhaps her vocal cords are simply sculpted that way, or maybe that’s just how lions speak, you’ve never talked to one before.

[[“I’m the new security guard”]]
[[“I’m just a visitor”]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="168" name="“I’m the new security guard”" tags="" position="1025,2125" size="100,100">You explain to the chimera that you are working your first day as the museum’s security guard. She watches you as you speak, and you can’t tell whether or not you should be afraid. Her metal eyes give no indication of emotion either way. 

“I see,” she rumbles, “though you don’t look fierce enough to protect anyone.”

[["Not fierce enough?"|“not fierce enough?”]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="169" name="“I’m just a visitor”" tags="" position="1200,2100" size="100,100">“Just a visitor? Welcome to the museum.” You express your thanks, the chimera acknowledges it with a nod of her lion’s head. The other two heads remain relatively still, the flaring of the goat’s nostrils and the flicker of the snake’s tongue the only indication that they are just as alive as the lion. “Have you explored this exhibit?” she asks, glancing around the room.

I mean look at you, no fangs, no talons, no fire, nothing. Absolutely nothing” The chimera has increased the pace at which she paces the room. The sound of her metal talons clicking on the floor is nearly constant, only pausing when she has to turn around to go the other direction. The sound is unpleasant, it makes you [[uneasy]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="171" name="uneasy" tags="" position="1025,2375" size="100,100">It doesn’t help that all three heads are still locked on to you, staring with dead metal eyes. The chimera continues, “I would’ve hoped that the museum could do better than a human for a security guard. They’re not known for their… fighting abilities.” 

[[“I don’t think I was really hired to fight anyone”]]

What were you hired to do then?” You tell the chimera that typically security jobs usually just mean making sure people don’t break in and steal things, and calling the police if they try. The chimera laughs at that, the sound is horrible. “Steal things? Like what, me?” When you nod she laughs again. “Nobody is stealing me, [[kid]]”</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="173" name="“Weren’t you killed by a human?”" tags="" position="900,2500" size="100,100">The chimera growls, a low sound that reverberates inside your skull. “Bellerophon is a special case, he was helped by the gods, as all heroes all” she stalks up to you, bringing her metal snout close to your face, which begins to feel hot, “heroes never did anything by themselves… frauds, all of them” 

Your face is starting to burn, Instinctively, you [[take a step back]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="174" name="take a step back" tags="" position="900,2625" size="100,100">The chimera watches your clumsy retreat with an air of distaste. The goat’s head huffs, and small spurts of fame flare out from its nostrils. “Some security guard you are” she mutters, before turning on heel and bounding back up to her [[pedestal]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="175" name="pedestal" tags="" position="900,2750" size="100,100">From her elevated position on the pedestal she glowers down at you. You think you might be beginning to understand the concept of hubris more intimately. 

You blink, and the chimera has turned back into metal. Some of the heat goes out of the room, all is cool and quiet once again.

Once back into position she appraises you, peering down her lions’ snout. “I hope this job works out for you.”

You nod, and express your thanks. The chimera must see something in your face, however, because her gaze softens somewhat. “Let me give you [[something]]”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="177" name="something" tags="" position="1025,2750" size="100,100">Much to your alarm, the goat head begins to retch. You step back in alarm as spurts of flame burst from the nostrils, briefly illuminating the chimera in golden firelight. 

All at once, it stops, and then an object comes flying out, its trajectory leads straight to your face. To prevent a broken nose you throw your arms up and somehow manage to catch the [[object]].
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="178" name="object" tags="" position="1025,2875" size="100,100">In your hands is a small stone, perfectly round and smooth. It’s slightly warm to the touch. You look up at the chimera to ask what it is, but her eyes are dull. You realize she has turned back into metal.

People so rarely enjoy actually learning from museums.” You express your interest in mythology and its history. Her mouth stretches to the side, lengthening in a way you realize is a smile. “Ah, it’s good to hear that at least somebody is still interested in us.”

Victoria Mae rolls her eyes at you. It’s impressive really; she’s got it down to an art 
form. “I was not aware that those over-sized house cats had a monopoly on something

You spot Jackie again, though she doesn’t notice you. She’s lost in thought, probably thinking of ways she’ll terrorize you next. You choose to follow her from behind, so that she doesn’t realize that you’re there. Nice. Good going. Probably better that way.

She jumps all the way to the river at the center of the forest, and you have to trudge behind her. Your jeans are wet now. Your socks are wet now. You are wet now. The sensory hell persists.

Yet, it was all worth it. Jackie stops right next to you, and you notice the distinct smell of rotten eggs and sulfur in the air. After looking around for a moment, you notice your old buddy, Josh, sitting on a tree stump by the riverside. In the evening light, it looks like he’s gazing at his own reflection. You’ve never seen an ape-man look more pensive. It doesn’t even seem like he’s noticed you at all.

Oh boy. This is gonna be a ''long conversation''. You can already feel it. Are you ready to have it?

[[I’m ready.|Bigfoot puzzle intro]]

[[Hold on.]]

&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;
Jackie looks up at you, curiously, and then starts gleefully bounding into the forest.

You follow closely behind, trusting in Jackie’s ability to navigate through this woodland hellscape. Dense bushes and winding forest pass you by, but you stay hot on Jackie’s trail.

After a while, Jackie takes you to another forest clearing. You wonder for a moment if this is the same one that you were at just a moment before. Just as you are about to fall on your knees and scream, you look around you. There is a light coming from different cardinal directions, pointing the way to different places in the forest and campsite.

Jackie stops in the middle of the clearing, and starts digging downwards. After a while, she pulls out a JOURNAL ENTRY signed by someone named “Josh” in big letters. You figure, using your powers of deductive reasoning, that this is Josh’s journal entry. Incredible. She hands it to you. It’s slightly wet.

Apparently, according to the entry, Josh used to work as a carpenter at a local carpentry company. Huh.

You figure that Jackie might still be able to take you to Josh. She looks up at you, curiously. It looks like she’s getting ready to go at any moment.

You check your watch. Your shift will be over in a few hours. 

You’re surprised by how quickly the time went by, and you feel sad for a moment, until you remember you’ll be back tomorrow night after a well-deserved day of rest. You have all summer to explore this museum, and the town of Spoons. Happiness blooms in your chest; you’re surprised by the intensity of it. 

There are many reasons for you to stay in this town, and in your mind’s eye, there is one person in particular who outshines the rest. Maybe you should visit them one last time before you leave for the night. That person is…

You don’t know why, but you feel yourself drawn to this room, for whatever reason. You feel sturdier, and more sure of yourself when you’re here. Maybe it’s just the conversation you had with Josh earlier.

As you enter, you see Jackie bound up towards you. You have to admit, she’s growing on you. Despite her terrifying rabbit eyes and massive antlers, she’s cute in her own way. She leads you through the forest, without you even having to ask, and you naturally trust her.

You don’t know why, but you feel yourself drawn to this room, for whatever reason. You feel a little lighter on your feet when you do. Maybe that’s just the saltwater hitting your lungs, though.

As you enter, you see Pearl sitting at the edge of her pool, with her hair up in a blue scrunchie. Sitting next to her, wearing a flowing white sundress, is Victoria Mae. The two of them seem to be chatting up a storm, while holding little sandwiches and lemonades in their hands. The slight sogginess of the sandwich bread tells you immediately that it was Pearl that made them. 

After a moment, you realize that both cryptids have copies of Bram Stoker’s //Dracula// in their laps. You seem to have wandered into a cryptid book club! You resist the urge to pull out your journal and write about this shit.

Victoria Mae and Pearl regard you. Pearl’s face seems to light up as she sees you, but Victoria Mae is the first to speak.

“Oh, hello $name. I hope you don’t mind, Pearlie and I love to discuss literature every few nights.”

Pearl nods. “Did you want to join us, $name? Vicky recommended this novel for this week.”

Victoria scoffs. “Well, if they want to join us then ''they’re going to need a book'' first. But I don’t imagine you participate in the finer parts of culture. Do you?”

You’re surprised to find the once carefully arranged exhibit in a state of disarray. Alfred is running around in circles, frantically huffing and puffing as fast as he can with his short legs. All of the clothes from Victoria Mae’s dresser had been gracelessly emptied out onto the floor, and that’s where you find her, sitting on a heap of expensive silks and vintage dresses with a dejected look on her face. Em is there, too, for some reason, sitting next to Victoria Mae with their knees pulled in and their wings folded up.

[[“Uh…what’s going on here?”]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="211" name="MothThirdBeat" tags="" position="5450,900" size="100,100">You enter Em’s exhibit. You’re surprised to find that a table has been placed in it, with two chairs. Em sits in one, and Josh sits in another. A single candle sits in the center of the table, which has been draped with a purple piece of cloth that looks like it could be one of Victoria Mae’s dresses. She is not going to like that, not to mention the potential fire hazard. 

	Anyway. You notice that Josh and Em are both writing things down on a sheet of 
paper, and there’s a few dice scattered on the table. It looks like they might be starting 
a round of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, though you’re not really sure how fun it is to play with only two people.

[[“What’s up?”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="212" name="PTB2" tags="" position="5575,75" size="100,100">Victoria smiles, showing her fangs. “Well, well, well. I thought you would’ve ended up using that ''book I gave you'' as a paperweight. I didn’t take you as an appreciator of the finer things.”

Pearl looks visibly upset and cuts in. “Of course $name can appreciate the finer things! They have fantastic taste! I know it to be a fact!”

Victoria looks at Pearl, and then back at you, and smiles even wider. Pearl turns red, and sinks a little deeper into her pool.

“Well, if Pearl believes in you so highly, then why don’t you join us for a discussion?”

Yeah, okay, sure. You can do [[this]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="213" name="PTBNo" tags="Edit" position="5575,200" size="100,100">Victoria Mae begins to laugh wildly. “Ha! Come back when you actually have a book to share with us.”

Pearl blushes. “It’s okay, $name, I did not know how to read until Victoria Mae showed me.”

“Yes, well, I imagine it would be exceedingly hard to read any book underwater. You would’ve been more than capable of learning without my help, darling.”

Pearl smiles a bit, and looks at you. “Find a book, $name! I’d love for you to join our book club.”

You exit the room, mocked for not being erudite. But dammit, you’ve gotta find a way to get in there. ''There must've been another way to get a copy of that book.''

[[Return |ThirdBeat]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="214" name="JTB2" tags="" position="5700,325" size="100,100">Pearl gasps, smiles, and begins to blush. “I thought you would have kept the \\saltwater taffy\\ I made for yourself. You are under no obligation to share it with all of us!”

Josh laughs, warmly. “Speak for yourself, sister! I’ve been hankering for some of your taffy since the last time you made it. Pearl’s a real hotshot at baking, did you know $name?”

Pearl turns beet red and sinks into her kiddie pool, as deep as she can. It’s not that deep.

Josh puts his hand on your shoulder. “You’re a real good person, you know that $name? Thank you so much for sharing. Come on, join us for a little bit of tea!”

You sit down with the cryptids for [[teatime]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="215" name="JTBNo" tags="Edit" position="5700,475" size="100,100">Pearl continues weeping. “I am sorry Joshua. You lifted me all the way from my exhibit here for a tea party without any treats!”

Josh smiles comfortingly, and pats Pearl’s shoulder. “Hey, it’s no biggie. The cardio is good for me anyways.”

Josh turns to you for a moment, with a bright look on his face. “Say, $name, can you ''find us some treats to share?'' I would do it myself, but I don’t want to leave Pearl alone with Jackie.”

Pearl interjects. “She scares me. And please do not get anything from the break room, please. I would prefer something ''homemade'' for our teatime.”

You exit the room, as Jackie leads you back through the forest. You wanted to join in on the teatime, but you needed to get treats first. ''There must've been somewhere in the museum where you could have found homemade saltwater taffy.''

When she notices you, she jumps back, and nearly falls into the pool.

She looks up at you and blushes before looking away. 

She lingers for a bit too long in your arms before she gets up in the water.

After a moment, you help Josh up from the ground. As you lift him upwards, he stands incredibly close to you. You can feel the warmth of his body next to yours. He wraps you in a hug, gives you a noogie on the head, and starts to laugh too.

&lt;section class="paper"&gt;\
	&lt;article class="paperheader"&gt;&lt;/article&gt;\
	&lt;div class="papertext"&gt;Dear $name,
	
By now, or maybe not, you may have realized that there is something particularly 
unique about this museum. It provides an experience that I highly doubt any other museum could even attempt to replicate. It serves as a sort of refuge for what humans like to refer to as “cryptids.” I myself prefer the more simple term “creature” but that is neither here nor there. I apologize for not being very forthright in my previous correspondence, but it is a matter of secrecy. Humans are most cruel and rather stupid; a deadly combination. I hope you can understand. 

	
I encourage you to explore the museum, but please pay special attention to the second floor. You may have been hired as a security guard, but there is more to your role than what meets the eye. Our exhibits, or perhaps guests would be a better term for them, are special; there is only so much protection a single human can offer them. However, based on what little I know about humans, it seems that they excel in the art of companionship, in being a friend, a shoulder to cry on, or even a most delicious meal! I doubt anyone will attempt to eat you, but, well, it is best to be cautious and aware of your surroundings. 
	&lt;/div&gt;\
&lt;/section&gt;

(This causes you to pause, just for a moment. You stop to think about all of the choices you’ve made up until this point, and decide that you’ve lived a fairly decent life. Anyway. You continue to read the letter.)

&lt;section class="paper"&gt;\
	&lt;article class="paperheader"&gt;&lt;/article&gt;\
	&lt;div class="papertext"&gt;
Enough of that nonsense! Museums are primarily places of education, and it is my deepest wish that even someone as scholarly as you can manage to learn a thing or you during your time here. And maybe, some of our guests can learn from you in turn. I regret that I will not be at the museum to greet you right at the start of your shift, but I expect that you are smart enough to keep yourself alive until I return.

Good luck, and Godspeed!

//Bzzzzz.// [But I’ll allow it.]

You find yourself grinning, in spite of yourself and this ridiculous situation. You 
thank Em profusely for indulging you. You apologize once more for being a general nuisance, and you leave the exhibit.

[[Yes |MerEndings]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="244" name="MerEndings" tags="" position="9325,300" size="100,100">As you enter Pearl’s room, you feel your heart start to beat even faster. There’s something about this shy mermaid that you cannot get over. Something about her hair, or her speech, or the way she’s so kind to everyone.

The saltwater hits your lungs again, but you know what you’re feeling this time is not from the saltwater.

Pearl looks up at you, sitting by the side of her pool, her small oven shoved to the far corner of the room. She has a terribly sad look on her face, with small glittering tears shimmering down her cheeks.

“Oh, hello, $name. I was hoping I would get to see you before I went.”

[["Where are you going?']]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="245" name="&quot;Where are you going?'" tags="" position="9325,425" size="100,100">“Back to Atlantis. I realized that I can not stay here. It would be too difficult for me to live like this.”

You wonder what she means by that, and lean down into the pool with her. You’re almost face to face, and her face turns red immediately. You think about how much you would miss that if she left.

“I wanted to give you something before I had to go. Something that you would remember me by. I know I am not good at many things, but I figure this would be enough.”

Pearl hands you a plate of beautiful, fish-shaped candies. They’re intricately made, with bits of seaweed inside and decorative flourishes on top. Pearl clearly put a lot of work into making these.

“You have been so kind to me, $name, even from the beginning. And I really appreciate it. You made me feel special and valued in a way that people have not made me feel before. But I have to go. I just wanted to give you something so you would remember me like I would remember you.”

Pearl looks at you expectantly, unsure of what to say next. She ties her hair up, and looks down at the water before her.

[["Pearl, I have feelings for you"]]
[[Say nothing]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="246" name="&quot;Pearl, I have feelings for you&quot;" tags="" position="9325,550" size="100,100">Suddenly, Pearl’s eyes light up at you. Her face turns the brightest red that you have ever seen. She looks at you for a moment, dumbfounded. As she leans over to you, she falls head first into the water.

[[Oh shit]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="247" name="Say nothing" tags="" position="9450,550" size="100,100">You don’t say anything. Pearl looks at you, holds back her tears, and leaps into the water. It is the first time you have seen Pearl enter the water fully.

“Thank you, $name. Thank you for everything. And goodbye. I hope we meet again someday.”

Pearl dives down into the briney deep. The water shimmers with a strange glow as she leaves, as if it too is crying with her.

That is the last you ever see of Pearl the Mermaid.

[[Continue| MerFinaleBetrayal]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="248" name="Oh shit" tags="" position="9325,675" size="100,100">You dive in immediately after her, and you return to the beautiful aquatic environment beneath Pearl’s pool. You hold your breath for long enough that you are able to grab her as she floats, and hold her in the water.

Pearl pulls you back up to the surface, wordlessly, and starts to cry in the middle of the pool. Wet and cold, you hold onto her and rub her back as she cries.

Pearl pulls away for a moment, tenderly, and holds your face. She manages to speak between sobs.

“I did not think that you felt the same way, $name. I did not want to live in a world where you did not feel the same way. And to think, when you told me, I was still so clumsy.”

You laugh a bit at that, and she starts to laugh with you. Suddenly, you notice…

[["Pearl, your hair!"]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="249" name="&quot;Pearl, your hair!&quot;" tags="" position="9325,800" size="100,100">Pearl feels her curly pink perm, having come undone by entering the water. She begins to laugh even more.

“Somehow, this does not feel like the most important thing in the world anymore! I would enter any body of water if it meant a moment with you, $name.”

[["Oh yeah?"]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="250" name="&quot;Oh yeah?&quot;" tags="Edit" position="9325,925" size="100,100">Playfully, you pull Pearl further down into the pool. She giggles a bit as you do, and lets herself fall down into the beautiful blue deep. The two of you stay there for a moment, floating, looking at each other in the pristine water. Pearl’s hair flows magnificently in the waves, finally free and loose.

“Thank you for showing me I am more than my mistakes, $name.”

Pearl kisses you as the two of you remain floating, in the serene magic of the tides.

The booming volume, the dignified tone, and the Irish accent let you know that it’s Nogard speaking through the public announcement system.

“$name, would you please come to my office for a moment? That’ll be all.”

[[Go to his office|NogardsOffice-Pearl]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="253" name="NogardsOffice-Pearl" tags="" position="7325,1000" size="100,100">You enter Nogard’s office. There, you see a timeless man with an intense look in his eyes give you a firm stare. He sits at his desk in an almost menacing way.

“Hello, $name. Come, sit down.”

You sit down at the only seat available at the office.

“As you know, I am the caretaker of this refuge. And, as its caretaker, it is my business to know about the well-being of all of my guests. Well, you wouldn’t believe what I heard about Pearl.”

Your heart starts pounding. Your face feels flush. What’s wrong with Pearl?

“She confessed to me, recently, that she wants to leave. Try to return to Atlantis, or something of the ilk. When I asked her why, she told me that she didn’t want to be in a place where she had feelings for someone. And that is because she said she wouldn’t be able to stand it if they didn’t feel the same.”

Your heart starts beating even faster.

“Pearl, as you know, is not going to be happy in Atlantis. And as for who she’s referring to? Well, the other cryptids here are like her brothers and sisters. But there’s been a security guard recently who’s been a recent outside factor.”

Nogard regards you with a smile.

“Whether or not you feel the same, $name, I recommend you go talk to her. Help her sort through her feelings.”

Nogard sends you on your way.

“And please,” he adds as you leave, “be kind to her.”

You return to the center room on the second floor.

“He confessed to me, recently, that he feels seen for the first time in a long time. And he tells me that it’s because of someone in particular that he’s feeling that way. Enough so that it even inspired his latest carpentry project, from what I can discern.”

Your heart starts beating even faster.

“Josh, as you know, is a sweetheart. But his heart can get latched onto people easily if they care about him. So I wanted to ask you, $name, do you really care about Josh?”

You contemplate your answer.

You sit between Pearl and Victoria Mae, criss-cross, who are arguing over the finer details of the novel. You can hardly understand what she’s saying, but you find yourself almost unconsciously listening to Pearl more.

“Darling, the point of the novel is that it doesn’t have a single protagonist,” Victoria Mae says. 

Pearl scrunches her nose. “I just think it would have been much better to me if it focused on Mina. She is the only good and decent person. I wanted it to focus more on her.”

“You’re completely neglecting the moral complexities of the other characters.”

“I am not neglecting anything! I just think someone like Mina, someone charming and good, would be a much better lead! It would certainly help with my engagement with the book.”

“Are you sure you’re not thinking of someone else?”

[[Continue|PTB3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="257" name="PTB3" tags="" position="5825,75" size="100,100">Pearl’s face turns bright red and Victoria Mae starts to laugh. It sounds almost evil, but you know Victoria Mae well enough at this point to know she’s just like that. You’re not sure what just happened there, but your heart starts to beat faster. Must be the fucking saltwater.

Victoria Mae snaps up her book and stands up. “I should get going. Pearl, darling, it is alway such a lovely evening when I get to spend time with you.”

Pearl looks at her quizzically and somehow turns even more red. “Wait, Vicky, you are leaving now? I thought we were going to discuss the ending.”

Victoria Mae looks at you both and smiles again. “Well, pardon my manners, Pearlie. I just remembered that Alfred needed me for…something or other. You two have fun!”

Victoria Mae almost runs over to the door. before she exits, you swear you almost see her wink.

[[Continue|PTB4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="258" name="PTB4" tags="" position="5950,75" size="100,100">You turn to look at Pearl, whose face has become more hair than face as she is burying herself once more in her curls. You open up the book and confess to Pearl that you’ve never actually read the thing.

Pearl glances up from her hair and looks at you gently. “Wait, do you mean it? No wonder you were so quiet during our book talk. I thought you were just nervous. Here, let me help you.”

You and Pearl spend the evening talking about the novel. At many points, you feel yourself losing focus on her words and focus on her eyes. Her hair. Her hands. But you want to listen to her, too. It’s just nice to spend time with someone so genuine and kind. How the hell did she get kicked out of Atlantis?

You make an effort to not get distracted…but you can’t figure out why it’s so hard. Oh well. Probably just the saltwater.

Yeah. It’s gotta be that.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="259" name="JoshThirdBeat2" tags="" position="5575,375" size="100,100">When you reach the campsite, you pop out of a small patch of bushes. You see a small table set up in the middle of the grass in front of you. Sitting in a wooden chair, holding a comically small teacup, is Josh. Across from him, with a kiddie pool retrofitted onto a wooden bench, is Pearl the mermaid. She is also holding a teacup, as well as the teapot, and is pouring Josh another cup.

Jackie bounds in front of you, and gnaws at your pants to get you to come along with her. You assent, marvel at your vocabulary, and step out of the bushes. Josh and Pearl both turn to look at you.

“What’s going on, $name?” Josh yells from the table. “What brings you out here to this neck of the woods?”

Pearl nods and waves politely. “Joshua and I are having one of our famous tea parties. But we seem to be missing some treats to go along with our drinks. It is a pity.”

Josh frowns and pats Pearl’s shoulder as she starts to gently weep.  “Teatime just ain’t the same without a little snack, brother. Do you happen to have any treats on you?”

[["No"|JTBNo]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="260" name="teatime" tags="" position="5825,325" size="100,100">The smell of pine, tea, and delicious taffy fills the air with a nostalgic scent. You haven’t been able to hike or camp like used to when you were younger, not for a long time. It feels nice to be out in nature again, and to share that moment with your new cryptid friends.

Pearl serves you a delicious blend of herbal tea that you just know she brewed herself. Josh greedily devours some taffy, but sneaks a few pieces here and there to Jackie, who is sitting on your lap. As you gently stroke the jackalope’s fur, you feel some relief from the recent zaniness of this job.

[[Continue|JTB3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="261" name="JTB3" tags="" position="5950,325" size="100,100">Josh turns to you for a moment, mouth stuffed full of candies.

“So, $name, we have these little tea parties pretty regularly,” he says.

Pearl looks up from her tea and assents. “Whenever we can find the time, really.”

Josh nods. “If you wanted to make this a regular thing, I wouldn’t mind at all. It’s nice to be around people who know me better than most others, y’know?”

Pearl sets down her teacup. “Joshua, $name knows about your past, then?”

“Yeah, dude! And they were so nice about it too. They really helped me get through a funk that I was getting through earlier. I honestly don’t think I would’ve felt as good right now if it weren’t for them!”

Pearl smiles through drinking her tea and looks at you. “So, that is why you are in such a good mood. Usually Joshua does not have that twinkle in his eye, $name, but I see it in him when he looks at you.”

Josh blushes, as much as a hairy ape person can, and nervously eats some more candies.

Pearl coughs, fakely, and stands up from her kiddie pool. “I am terribly sorry to leave so soon, Joshua, but I simply must be getting back to my exhibit now.”

Josh frowns. “Ah, dude, what’s up? You never leave tea time so early in the magically-sustained evening.”

Pearl blushes and looks at you both. “Oh, nothing. I simply remembered something that requires my attention. Yes, that is it.”

Pearl whistles and suddenly the four fur-bearing trout pop out of the bushes, walking on their hind fins. They waddle over to Pearl, grab her kiddie pool, and start walking back towards the entrance.

“Cheese it boys,” one of the trout says.

[[Continue |JTB4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="262" name="JTB4" tags="" position="6075,325" size="100,100">Josh looks at you, gently, and smiles with a genuine tenderness that you haven’t seen on him before.You wonder why didn’t realize that he has such beautiful, hazel eyes. There’s something so soulful about them.

After a while, you realize Josh was staring at you too. He shakes his head. “Thank you again for helping me out earlier. Now that you’re here, I actually wanted to talk to you about you. What’s your deal, man? What brings you here? Why this place?”

As Josh pours you another cup of tea, you can’t help but feel comfortable telling him everything. After all, you did the same for him. You tell him about how you used to travel into the mountains with your family when you were younger, hike through the woods, and how you all used to stay at a little cabin that your folks rented out. You tell him how being there is what sparked your interest in the supernatural and cryptids. You reminisce on the times long gone, and start to feel a little sad.

He puts a hand on your shoulder.. “You know, I don’t have much in this world, $name. But this place, it’s all mine. And, if you’d like, you can come here anytime. I know it won’t be the same as spending time with your folks. But as long as you’re here, I’ll be here to give you some company.”

You hug Josh, and you feel a tenderness you haven’t felt in some time.

It’s good to share these things with him.

//Bzz. Bzz.// [Hi, $name.] Even Em’s greeting to you sounds pathetic. 

“I’m terribly sorry for the mess, $name, but I’m afraid that I’ve lost something rather important to me,” Victoria Mae explains.”Or, rather…”

//Bzzzzz. Bzzzzz. Bzzzz.// [I was the one who lost something important.] Em’s antennas seem to droop.

“Oh, I don’t blame you, Mr. Moth,” Victoria Mae says hurriedly. “I know that you meant no harm to me.”

[[“What is it that you’re looking for?”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="264" name="“What is it that you’re looking for?”" tags="" position="5700,675" size="100,100">“A ring,” Victoria Mae says. “A family heirloom of mine. It’s rather shiny, and sometimes I lend it to Mr. Moth. They are quite fascinated by it.”

//Bzzzzz. Bzzzz. Bzzzzzzzzz.// [I put it somewhere safe, but I can’t remember where.]

From across the room, Alfred lets out a tortured groan. “My lady! Why would you do such a thing? Everyone knows moths have terrible memories. EVERYONE!” You yourself did not know this, but you doubt Alfred would care.

You do. You pull the jar out of your backpack that you had found in the kitchen earlier. At first, you had thought that the jar had just been filled with junk, but now you realize that it’s not just typical junk. It’s Em’s junk, and they had placed the ring in the jar for safe-keeping.

Trying not to appear too grossed out, you open the jar and pull out the ring. You hold it up and present it to everyone. It shines like a star in between your fingers.

[[Continue |VTB3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="267" name="“No.”" tags="Edit" position="5950,750" size="100,100">“Oh, dear.” Victoria Mae sighs. “I should not have gotten my hopes up.”

//Bzzzzz. Bzzzzzzzz.// [I am sorry. This is all my fault.] Em’s antennas drop even lower, and Victoria Mae awkwardly pats their knee. Alfred lets out a shrill shriek of indignation, and Victoria Mae shoots him a withering glare.

You’re surprised by Victoria Mae’s willingness to defend Em. It had never occurred to you before that these two could be friends, and you suddenly become determined to help find this ring.

You ask Em if they remember the last place where they had the ring. 

//Bzz. Bzzzzz. Bzzzzzzzzzz. Bzzzzzzzzzz.// [Hmm. I know I put it somewhere for safe-keeping. The exact location of it is a mystery to me.]

“Typical moth,” Alfred mumbles to himself.

You feel bad for this strange collection of cryptids. Alfred is clearly stressed out about the loss of this valuable possession, and even though Victoria Mae is trying her best to hide it, she seems upset as well. Em obviously blames themself for losing the ring even though it’s an easy mistake that anyone could have made. 

You don’t want this misfortune to ruin the friendship between moth and vampire, so you share with them your resolve to find the ring. Em seems to perk up a little after hearing this, and even Victoria Mae smiles, though she still looks doubtful. 

“This museum is very big, $name,” she warns you. “Lots of nooks and crannies. I won’t be upset if you can’t find it. It’s just a ring, after all. I have plenty of others.” 

You promise Victoria Mae that you’ll find the ring. It’s important to you that you do. 

You try to think of places where it could be. You feel like you’ve explored the second floor pretty thoroughly. ''Maybe it’s somewhere on the first floor?''

[[Return |ThirdBeat]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="268" name="VTB3" tags="" position="6075,625" size="100,100">Em buzzes in excitement, flapping their wings as they rise up from the floor. Alfred starts clapping profusely. 

However, it is Victoria Mae that holds your attention. She remains seated on the floor, and she looks up at you thoughtfully. Her green eyes flash at you, and she raises her left hand slightly. You notice that her left ring finger is bare.

You kneel down next to her on top of her pile of expensive clothes. You try your best to wipe the ring down with your shirt before you gently reach for Victoria Mae’s outstretched hand. 

[[Continue |VTB4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="269" name="VTB4" tags="" position="6200,625" size="100,100">Just as you're about to place the ring on her finger, you are interrupted by a loud burp. 

//Bzzzz bzzz.// [Excuse me.] 

You look over your shoulder. Em stands sheepishly behind you, evidently the source of the burp.

Victoria Mae frowns at Em. “Mr. Moth, that is incredibly rude of you.”

//Bzzzzz. Bzzzzz. Bzzzzzzzz. Bzzzzzz.// [I’m sorry, Victoria Mae. I don’t know what’s come over me. I will leave now.]

Em bows their head slightly. They stretch out their wings once more before picking up Alfred, who’s too surprised to protest beyond an undignified squeal. Just as they begin to float away, Em shoots you a knowing look, all of their sheepishness gone. You get the feeling that they burped on purpose so that you and Victoria Mae could have a moment alone together. You’re not sure how you feel about that, but it’s not every day that you get to have Mothman as your wingman, pun unintended. 

[[Continue |VTB5]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="270" name="VTB5" tags="" position="6325,625" size="100,100">Victoria Mae clears her throat, trying to get your attention. You turn back around to find her hand still lingering in the air, her eyebrows arched as she stares at you expectantly. 

“Well, go on then,” she says, gesturing at the ring. “We don’t have all night.”

You smile, easily seeing past her feigned annoyance and into the happiness you know she’s trying to keep secret. You take her left hand into your own and carefully place the ring on her finger.

[[“It fits!”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="271" name="“It fits!”" tags="" position="6450,625" size="100,100">Victoria Mae’s laughter fills the room, without any malice or sharp edges. It’s light and airy. You wish you could bottle it up, like champagne. 

“Well, of course it fits, $name. I took it to a jeweler years ago to get the size adjusted.”

She holds out her hand in front of her, examining the ring on her finger. It’s small and bronze, simple compared to the other pieces of jewelry she wears, but it still shines in the candlelight.

You reassure her that finding the ring was no problem to you, and she shakes her head. 

“I meant to say thank you for being here. Tonight, and for the rest of the summer. I don’t know if that’s improper to say or not…”

[[Yes.|BFF2]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="275" name="BFF2" tags="" position="9700,300" size="100,100">As you enter Josh’s room, you feel your heart start to beat even faster. There’s something about this friendly sasquatch that you cannot get over. Something about his eyes, his embrace, his warm presence in the world.

The scent of pine lingers in the air, and it follows you as Jackie runs up to greet you. She jumps into your arms and you pet her gently. It took some time, but man. This thing has really grown on you. You give her some scratches behind the ear. She begins to thump her legs, and you smile.

You set her down, and bounds downwards to show you that she’s ready to lead you. You follow her into the forest, and she takes you to the campsite. You’ve gotten better at following her. It feels like an instinct at this point.

Standing beside a massive wooden cabin at the campsite is Josh. The cabin has an intricate mahogany door; the archway is made of two wooden jackalopes touching paws at the keystone. It is otherwise a sturdy log cabin, complete with a green roof and a beautiful polished finish.

Josh greets you with a wave.

“$name! I was hoping that I would see you.”

[["What's all this?"]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="276" name="&quot;What's all this?&quot;" tags="" position="9700,425" size="100,100">“Oh, this?” Josh starts to blush, and he puts his hand behind his head.

“This is the project that I was telling you about. I wanted to keep it a surprise. I remember you told me how you used to travel with your family to cabins in the woods when you were younger. I know it’s not perfect, but I figured it might be something that you like.”

[["You built this for me?" |BFF3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="277" name="BFF3" tags="" position="9700,550" size="100,100">“Yeah! This way you can have a place of your own. Don’t even worry about it, dude. It was really no trouble. It’s just nice to have someone that inspires me to build again.”

Josh looks up at you, his smile as wide and precious as always. He stares at you expectantly, waiting for you to say something.

[["Josh, I have feelings for you."]]
[["Josh, this isn't right."]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="278" name="&quot;Josh, I have feelings for you.&quot;" tags="" position="9650,675" size="100,100">Suddenly, Josh’s eyes light up. Then it starts to water.

[[Oh shit |BFF4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="279" name="&quot;Josh, this isn't right.&quot;" tags="" position="9775,675" size="100,100">Josh’s smile immediately melts into a frown. His eyes start to water, and he looks at you with an anguish that you remember only seeing in him when you helped him.

“I don’t understand. I thought…”

Josh slides down and sits on the ground. You decide to sit down next to him.

“I’m so sorry, $name. I completely misread that, huh?” Josh starts laughing, but you can see that the laughing is through tears. His fur starts to mat up in his face.

“I should’ve learned by now. The expression of love isn’t just giving and giving, huh? No matter what you do, that’s never enough.”

[["You can't forget to give to yourself too, Josh."]]
[[Stay silent]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="280" name="BFF4" tags="Edit" position="9650,800" size="100,100">Josh begins to cry, unabashedly and intensely, and you immediately kneel down next to him. Through his tears, there is a bright smile forming. 

You hold him, close to you, and hug him. His fur feels warm to the touch. You console him, as the skies turn bright with the sunset around you. He looks up at you, and grins.

“I didn’t think that you felt the same way, $name.”

Josh gets up and starts to pace around you. You sit dumbfounded on the ground. “I mean, you shouldn’t just like me because I made you something. And I don’t just like you because you gave me something. And, you should know, my self-worth isn’t based on you. I’m past that. I love myself, first and foremost, but there’s, like, so much love in my heart I want to give. And I want to give it to you. And Jackie. And all my friends at the museum. And-”

You get up and hold Josh’s hands. He stops pacing and starts to laugh.

“Yeah, yeah. I know. I’m rambling again. But I just think-”

[["Why don't I change your mind?"]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="281" name="&quot;You can't forget to give to yourself too, Josh.&quot;" tags="" position="9900,750" size="100,100">You start to explain that, though you appreciate the gesture, you know that Josh’s self-worth cannot be determined by a single individual. You express that, no matter how nice this gift is, you know that this gift is coming from a place of dependency and not from a place of genuine love.

Josh continues smiling, widely, though his eyes are full of sorrow. “You’re right. I’m so sorry.”

Josh gets up and Jackie bounds over to him. Josh gives her a gentle pet on the head.

“I’m going to go away for a while, I think. Try to internalize that self-worth thing, y’know? Take care of Jackie for me while I’m gone.”

Jackie looks up at you, and jumps into your arms. She looks up at you, clearly not understanding what is happening around her.

“Thank you, $name. I hope we meet again someday.”

Josh walks away into the woods, and you can hear the door close behind him. 

That is the last you ever see of Josh the sasquatch.

[[Continue |BigFootBadEnding]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="282" name="Stay silent" tags="" position="9900,625" size="100,100">You stay silent, and Josh looks at you as you do, hoping for an answer.

When he gets none, he simply smiles. “Yeah. I thought so.”

Josh puts his fingers to his mouth, whistles, and Jackie comes bounding into his arms. He hugs her, before he sets her down.

“I gotta go, I think. I can’t deal with all this shit in my heart. Thank you, $name. Thanks for letting me know that love is hopeless. I mean it.”

There is a bitterness in his words that you do not recognize. When you think back on this moment later, you know that this tone is the crumbling vestiges of a broken man. 

Josh walks away into the woods, and you can hear the door close behind him. Jackie tries to follow him, and Josh commands her to sit in place. He gives her one last pet on the head before departing.

That is the last you ever see of Josh the sasquatch.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="285" name="a cardboard box." tags="" position="1575,1675" size="100,100">Curiosity gets the best of you, and you pull the box down from its perch. Inside, you find a skull grinning up at you. You’re not all that surprised when it starts talking to you.

“Hey, kid. Got any smokes?”

You inform the skull that smoking is bad for your health, and even though the eye sockets of the skull are empty, you felt like it had just rolled its long-lost eyes at you. 

“Oh, give me a break. I should still thank you, though. I’ve been stuck in that box for who knows how long, and I probably woulda stayed in there until the second coming of Christ if you hadn’t found me.”

You ask the skull where it’s proper place in the museum is.

“Who knows? Just find a nice spot for me, will you?” 

You inform the skull that you’re not totally familiar with the museum, but you suggest keeping the skull in your backpack until you can find a suitable place for it.. 

If the skull had shoulders, it probably would have shrugged at you. “Sounds good to me. I’ll just take a nap, if you don’t mind.”

You ponder the logistics of that as you place the skull in your backpack, and decide not to think about it too hard.

we might have lost track of our Dungeon Master about two months ago.”

//Bzzzzz. Bzzzzz.// [It’s been more than two months.]

Josh waves his hand in a gesture of indifference. “Two months, three months, doesn’t really matter in the long run.”

//Bzz. Bzzzzzz.//[Yes. It does suck.]

You feel bad for the two of them. They both seem really into this whole D&amp;D thing, and you hate to see them disappointed. You should probably go find this Dungeon Master.

“Do ya know how long I was stuck in that box for?” he complains once he’s finished cursing them out.

Josh and Em are considerably more happy to see Yorick than he is to see them.

“Bro, we’ve been looking for you for months,” Josh cries. He takes Yorick from you and places him on the table. “We’ve totally been missing our Dungeon Master! We tried playing a few times with Jackie, but it didn’t end well.” 

//Bzzzzz. Bzzzzz.// [She is terrifying.] You’re glad to find that you’re not the only one who is afraid of the jackalope.

“Ha, ha, yeah, she’s a little intense. But now, thanks to $name, we can start a new campaign with you. What’d you think, Yorick?’”

“Oh, fuck you.”

“That’s the spirit.” Josh turns to you. “$name, you wanna join? We’re still making our characters and stuff.”

C’mon, Yorick. We’ve got a lot of catching up to do.” Josh snatches Yorick up from the table despite the skull’s protests before exiting the exhibit, leaving you alone with Em. 
You sit down next to Em and pick up a blank character sheet. You stare at it for a few minutes before putting it down, completely lost. You’ve never played D&amp;D before in your life. Armor class? Saving throws? You’ve always considered yourself to be a pretty big nerd, but this is totally beyond you. 

You can’t focus anyway, not with Em sitting right there next to you. Their wings brush up against your shoulder, and you shiver at the touch. 

//Bzzzzzz. Bzzzzzzz.//[Thank you for finding Yorick, $name.]

You assure them that it’s not such a big deal. It is, after all, pretty hard to miss a talking skull.

You can feel yourself start to blush. Em’s red eyes blink at you, and you can’t really tell, but you think they might be smiling. 

You two sit there for a while, side by side, as you watch Em fill out their character sheet. You listen to them explain the rules of D&amp;D, but mostly you’re focused on the sound of their voice. You like how it hums in your ears.

Josh and Yorick never reappear, but you find yourself glad they didn’t. You have all summer; plenty of time to play a campaign of D&amp;D. 

And plenty of time to hang out with Em.

“Victoria Mae has been talking to me about her rings again. She’s been showing them off, and I didn’t think anything of it. But recently, she’s been looking at them with a twinkle in her eye. If you ask me, I think she’s planning to -- through some miracle -- actually share the rings.”

Your heart starts beating even faster.

“Victoria Mae, as you know, can be difficult. She demands a lot of everyone, and she isn’t always kind to others. She’s from an entirely different era, for goodness’ sake. That’s why when she does start to truly love someone, it can be so difficult for her to say it to them.”

Your face starts to get warm. You didn’t know that she could feel that way.

“Whether or not you feel the same, $name, I recommend you go talk to her. Let her know what she’s in for. We don’t want her to get even more capricious.”

[[Return |Transition]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="408" name="PearlTransition" tags="" position="6700,200" size="100,100">You enter Pearl’s room. The saltwater smell hits you immediately. She looks up from the pool, as she is taking the fur-bearing trout through a choral number.

She looks at you, gives you a soft smile, and waves. “Hello, $name. I am just helping the trout to sing. I am completely alright. Do not forget to check in on the others!”

Aw. Always good to see Pearl.

[[Return |Transition]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="409" name="JoshTransition" tags="" position="6450,200" size="100,100">You enter Josh’s room. The scent of the pine trees fills your lungs. Jackie bounds towards you and happily jumps into your arms. She’s kind of cute, you guess.

She takes you through the forest to see Josh. It’s nice to experience the hike, you suppose. When you reach him, you see he is grilling on a small grill.

“Hey, $name! Good to see you, dude. I’m chillin’ over here. You want a burger?”

The burger is fucking delicious. But it looks like Josh is okay, though.

[[Return |Transition]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="410" name="MothTransition" tags="" position="6575,325" size="100,100">You enter Em’s room. The Christmas lights are blinding today. You hear an immense buzzing from the corner of the room before Em reveals themselves.

You can see that they are gnawing on a piece of clothing. You try to separate it from their mouth and you end up playing a game of tug-of-war. You win, and Em sulks aside.

\\BZZZZZZZ.\\ [You motherfucker. Leave me.]

You think Em is fine. Sweet little creature.

[[Return |Transition]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="411" name="MothFinale" tags="" position="8950,175" size="100,100">As you enter Em’s room, you feel your heart start to beat even faster. There’s something about this big fucking insect that you just cannot get over. Something their buzzes. And their antennae. And their buzzes. Mostly the buzzes.

You see Em hunched over in the middle of the room. You cannot wait to hear what they have to say. It’s all been leading up to this. You want to be thoroughly romanced by this lamp loving creature.

//BZZZZ?// (Wanna bone?)

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="412" name="MothFinaleYes" tags="" position="8875,300" size="100,100">You are wrapped up in Em’s beautiful antennae. They start licking you up and down, and you feel all of your erogenous zones being stimulated. You start to stroke their wings and, by god, are they flaky. This goes on for a while, as the two of you discover what each of you enjoys in your deeply different bodies.

The two of you spend the night in ecstasy and bliss. To think that all you ever needed in your life was the love of a vaguely humanoid insect.

The next morning, Em lays eggs. Oh, good. Breakfast.

[[CREDITS]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="413" name="MothFinaleNo" tags="" position="9025,300" size="100,100">Em’s expression becomes bleak and twisted. They retreat to the wardrobe and lock themselves within. You try to open the wardrobe again, but it is locked from the inside.

You leave the exhibit, unsure of what to do with yourself except understand that you are apparently sexy to bugs.

That is the last you ever see of Em the Mothman.

[[Continue |MothFinaleNo2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="414" name="MothFinaleNo2" tags="" position="9025,425" size="100,100">You reenter Em’s room. 

There is a buzzing from the wardrobe.

You ignore it. You have actual work to do. What is this nonsense?

You never regret anything ever again. Fuck this bug.

[[CREDITS]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="415" name="CallFromNogard-Mothman" tags="" position="7625,625" size="100,100">You enter Nogard’s office. There, you see a timeless man with an intense look in his eyes give you a firm stare. He sits at his desk in an almost menacing way.

“Hello, $name. Come, sit down.”

You sit down at the only seat available at the office.

“As you know, I am the caretaker of this refuge. And, as its caretaker, it is my business to know about the well-being of all of my guests. Well, you wouldn’t believe what I heard about Em.”

Your heart starts pounding. Your face feels flush. What’s wrong with Em?

“They spoke to me for the first time. And, frankly, that is concerning because Em never comes to me about anything. Em is a bizarre creature that I can hardly fathom, but I understood this feeling clearly. They mentioned you by name.”

Your heart starts beating even faster.

“Em clearly has grown attached to you, which I think is admirable. I’m glad that you’ve humored them and given them your time. But how much do you mean it, [NAME]?”

You contemplate your answer.

“Whether or not you do, $name, I recommend you go talk to them. They miss it when you aren’t around.”

Nogard sends you on your way.

“And please,” he adds as you leave, “be kind to them.”

You return to the center room on the second floor.

That sounds understandable. It looks like Em might need some alone time, you decide to give them space.

There’s something that compels you about this vampire, a feeling that you have never experienced before.

Victoria Mae has changed into her pajamas, and is settling herself into her coffin. You check your watch. You realize that the morning is just around the corner.

“Hello, NAME,” she greets you. “I was just getting ready for bed. Is there anything I can do for you?”

Your eyes linger towards her left hand. She’s still wearing the ring. 

Victoria Mae’s eyes follow your gaze, and she looks down at her hand. You think about the other ring you saw earlier, and you ask her about it. 

“Oh, that?” She pulls the ring out from the depth of one of her pockets. 

“The reason why the ring was so important to me is because it’s part of a pair,” Victoria Mae says to you. 

[[“Wedding rings?”]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="420" name="“Wedding rings?”" tags="" position="8675,300" size="100,100">“Don’t be ridiculous!” Victoria Mae gasps. “I…I can’t believe you would even suggest such a thing.” She begins fanning herself. 

“No, NAME, they are promise rings,” she explains once she’s calmed herself down. “I was actually planning on giving one to someone special.”

You’re about to ask her who, until you realize that she’s staring at you pointedly. You point to yourself, and she nods. 

“Yes, you,” she says laughing. “Will you accept it?”

[[“Yes, I accept.”]]

[[“I’m afraid I can’t accept.”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="421" name="“Yes, I accept.”" tags="" position="8612.5,425" size="100,100">She beams at you happily, and despite the fact that she is a vampire and technically dead, she looks more alive than anyone you’ve ever met. She embraces you tightly in a hug; both hot and cold at the same time, both sunbeams singing and the rivers of Antarctica flowing through your veins. She is remarkably tall, and you love this about her. 

“Normally, you would have to ask my mother for permission first, or I would ask your parents, but alas.” Victoria Mae lifts up your right hand, and places the ring on your finger. You shiver at the cool touch of the metal against your skin. “These are rather unusual circumstances.”
You can’t help but agree. You take Victoria Mae’s hand and plant a small kiss on it, all the while keeping eye contact with her. Her green eyes meet yours and it feels like coming home.

[[CREDITS]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="422" name="“I’m afraid I can’t accept.”" tags="" position="8750,425" size="100,100">“Oh. I see.” Crestfallen, Victoria Mae turns away from you. “If you don’t mind, I would like to be alone.”

She hurriedly goes into her coffin, and slams the lid shut. Regret swells up in your heart, but it’s too late now.

[[Continue |VampFinaleNo]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="423" name="VampFinaleNo" tags="" position="8750,550" size="100,100">You reenter Victoria Mae’s room. Alfred walks up to greet you, standing in between you and Victoria Mae’s coffin.

“Unfortunately, I will have to ask you to leave,” Alfred says to you. “The mistress does not wish to see you.”

You understand. You probably wouldn’t want to see you either, if you were in her shoes. 

You cast one last longing glance at Victoria Mae’s coffin. You’ve never met someone like her, and you’ll probably never meet anyone like her again in the future. You imagine your next couple of shifts will be awkward, as the two of you will most likely try to avoid each other. You wonder if you should ask Nogard if he has any openings during the day. 

Still. You have all summer. There is time to grow, and heal. Maybe you can make amends with Victoria Mae, or at least try to befriend her again. 

You have time, after all, and Victoria Mae has all of immortality.
